    API for YRIKKA APEX - an automated context-based evaluation system for object detection models.
    
    ## Authentication
    All API endpoints require an API key to be included in the request header as `x-api-key`.
    
    **To get your API key:**
    1. [Sign up for an APEX API key](https://apex.yrikka.com/login?client_id=3fn9ks2vmp3gdis9jvts464v31&response_type=code&scope=email+openid+phone&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyrikka.com%2F)
    2. Verify your email address
    3. Check your email for your API key
    
    Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
    
    ## Overview
    The APEX API allows you to:
    1. Upload a model package (as a tarball)
    2. Submit evaluation jobs with contextual descriptions
    3. Get context-specific evaluation results to understand how your model performs in different scenarios
    
    ## Complete Process
    Here is the end-to-end process for evaluating your object detection model with APEX:
    
    1. **Prepare your model package**:
       - Create an `inference.py` script that implements the required functions:
         - `model_fn(model_dir, device)`: Loads your model
           - **Input**: 
             - `model_dir` (str) - Path to the directory containing your model weights
             - `device` (str) - Either 'cpu' or 'cuda' - your function is responsible for moving the model to this device
           - **Output**: Your loaded model object (can be any format your predict_fn accepts)
         - `input_fn(image, device)`: Prepares input for your model
           - **Input**: 
             - `image` (PIL.Image) - A PIL Image object
             - `device` (str) - Either 'cpu' or 'cuda' - your function is responsible for moving input data to this device
           - **Output**: Processed input in the format your model requires (e.g., numpy array)
         - `predict_fn(image_array, model)`: Runs inference
           - **Input**: 
             - `image_array` - Output from input_fn
             - `model` - Model object returned by model_fn
           - **Output**: Raw prediction results (can be any format your output_fn accepts)
         - `output_fn(predictions)`: Formats results
           - **Input**: `predictions` - Output from predict_fn
           - **Output**: Tuple of 3 numpy arrays:
             - `class_names`: np.ndarray[str] - Array of class name strings
             - `confidences`: np.ndarray[float] - Array of confidence scores
             - `bounding_boxes`: np.ndarray[float] with shape (N,4) containing [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
       - Define a `CLASS_MAPPING` dictionary in your script that maps class indices to names
       - Create a `manifest.json` file that specifies your entry point and model file names
       - Include your model weights file (e.g., `model.pt`)
    
    2. **Package your model**:
       - Create a tarball (tar.gz) of your model directory containing all required files
       - Ensure your package follows the structure defined in the Model Package Structure section
       - Note: Your model package should be less than 4GB in size
    
    3. **Upload your model package**:
       - Request a presigned URL using the `/presigned` endpoint
       - Use the presigned URL to upload your tarball to our S3 storage
    
    4. **Submit an evaluation job**:
       - Call the `/submit-job` endpoint with your model package URI, target classes, and context description
       - This will return a job ID that you can use to track your evaluation
    
    5. **Monitor job status**:
       - Periodically check the `/job-status` endpoint with your job ID
       - When the job completes, you'll receive comprehensive evaluation metrics
    
    The sample code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yrikka/model-evaluation-example) demonstrates this complete workflow.
    
    ## Model Package Structure
    Your model package should contain the following:
    - `model.pt` - Your model weights file
    - `inference.py` - The inference script implementing required functions
    - `manifest.json` - Metadata specifying entry points and model files
    
    See the example implementation for more details on required functions and structure.
